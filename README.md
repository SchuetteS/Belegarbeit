# Getting started

```
Ruby Version : 2.6.5
```

To get started with the app, clone the repo and
then install the needed gems:
```
$ bundle install --without production
```
Next, migrate the database:
```
$ rails db:migrate
```
Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything
is working correctly:
```
$ rails test
```
If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the
app in a local server:
```
$ rails server
```
Heroku Link:
```
$ https://studentdelivery.herokuapp.com/
